And that's all!

## About

This is a project created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). I tried it for the first time and is insanely faster than ``create-react-app``. On the other hand, it is not that robust when the compilation fail and we need the error log.

This game was developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to code fast.

npm: '9.4.0', Node: '18.12.1'
